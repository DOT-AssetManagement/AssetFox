    /* We currently have tests that fail only when they are run in 
     * conjunction with certain other tests. To debug that
     * while retaining one's sanity, it is pretty much mandatory to have something like this class. The problem
     * is that one needs to be able to set breakpoints that only fire in
     * the case where some code is about to do the wrong thing. To do that,
     * one needs to be able to say externally that the error condition is about to happen.
     * The code can't be in a test namespace, because the breakpoint itself needs to be
     * callable from non-test code. In general, when a PR is completed, the project containing
     * this class should NOT be a part of any solution. However, the class itself should be keept
     * in source control, I think, because the need for it will sporadically reappear.
