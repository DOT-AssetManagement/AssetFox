# iAM Benefit Calculation

## Essential Symbols & Terms

- $A$ : benefit attribute
- $B$ : benefit value
- $C$ : cumulative benefit value
- $L$ : benefit limit value
- $N$ : outlook period
- $W$ : benefit weight attribute
- $b$ : benefit-instant value
- $b'$ : limit-relativized unweighted (LRU) benefit-instant value
- $b^A$ : benefit attribute value
- $w$ : benefit weight attribute value
- $t$ : year of outlook period, $t \in \{0, 1, \dots, N\}$

## Overview of Calculation

The benefit value $B_T$ of treatment $T$ is the cumulative benefit value $C_T$ of $T$ minus the cumulative benefit value $C_P$ of the passive treatment $P$:

$$
B_T = C_T - C_P
$$

Each $C$ is calculated independently over the outlook period $N$, a fixed whole number of years starting from the current year.
To understand the calculation, it's helpful to visualize with a line plot of yearly benefit-instant values over time.

</div>

Cumulative benefit is the area under each of these curves.
Benefit is the area between the two curves.
(Negative benefit is possible.)
Each point on the plot is a $(t, b)$ pair.
Given the series $b = (b_0, b_1, \dots, b_N)$ of benefit-instant values over outlook period $N$, the cumulative benefit is

$$
C = \sum_{t=1}^{N}\left(b_{t-1} + \frac{b_t - b_{t-1}}{2}\right)
$$

For a given outlook year $t$ and benefit weight attribute value $w_t$, the benefit-instant value is

$$
b_t =
\begin{cases}
b_t' \times w_t &\text{if $w$ is defined} \\
b_t'            &\text{if $w$ is not defined}
\end{cases}
$$

where, given the benefit limit value $L$ and benefit attribute value $b_t^A$, the LRU benefit-instant value is

$$
b_t' =
\begin{cases}
\max(0, b_t^A - L) &\text{if $A$ decreases with deterioration} \\
\max(0, L - b_t^A) &\text{if $A$ increases with deterioration.}
\end{cases}
$$

Given the benefit attribute value series $b^A = (b_0^A, b_1^A, \dots, b_N^A)$, these equations allow calculation of $C$ and then $B_T$.
